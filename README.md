# About me

Hi, I'm Anthony, an experienced technical writer of developer documentation.

Currently, I'm a contracted technical writer at Google, where I write and edit conceptual video scripts, task-based coding tutorials,  and quizzes that help developers worldwide use Google's developer technology.

Technical writing is actually my fourth career, but I love this field, so I don't intend to reinvent myself again. Now that I finally found the career for me, I can go deep, so I spend my free time taking online trainings to improve not only my basic tech-writing skills, but also my coding skills. 

Sometimes, code trainings require me to write fully functional programs, so I share these projects on GitHub as proof of my ability to read and write code. Also, the trainings don't instruct me to document the code, but I document it anyway to prove my ability to do that, too. 

Thanks for reading!

- Anthony
