# About me

Hi, I'm Anthony, a seasoned technical writer and editor of globally distributed developer documentation. 

Currently, I'm a remote and contracted technical writer/editor at Google. In this role, I educate developers of all skill levels around the world about Google's developer technology through the technical writing and editing of software documentation for various product areas (PAs) across the company, including AI/ML, Android, Google Cloud, and Web. 

More specifically, I write and edit conceptual video scripts, task-based coding tutorials, and other forms of technical documentation that involve various markup and programming languages (HTML, Kotlin, JavaScript, Markdown, Python, and XML) by collaborating with engineering team members from different PAs. I also provide quality assurance by testing the documentation to ensure that it's accurate and all code works as expected. 

In terms of hard skills, I work with the following:
* Several markup languages, including HTML, Markdown, and XML
* Several programming languages, including Kotlin, JavaScript, and Python
* Several other tools of note, including Acrolinx, Git, GitHub, Google Workspace, the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, and Frame.io

In terms of soft skills, my colleagues and coworkers describe me as the following:
* Smart
* Adaptable
* A fast learner
* A problem solver
* A leader when necessary as an individual contributor
* Comfortable with ambiguity
* Always willing to act
* Funny (Some might say funny looking, but the point still standsâ€”I'm funny.)

Technical writing is actually my fourth career, but I love this field, so I don't intend to reinvent myself again. Now that I finally found the career for me, I figured that it was time to create a portfolio of my publicly available work, so I created this GitHub profile. To see samples of writing, editing, and coding work, see the respective repositories. To learn more about me or get in touch, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panissidi/).

Thanks for reading!

Anthony
