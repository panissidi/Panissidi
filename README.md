Hi, I'm Anthony, an experienced technical writer of developer documentation.

Currently, I'm a contracted technical writer at Google, where I partner with software engineers to write and edit conceptual video scripts and task-based coding tutorials that help developers worldwide understand how to use Google's developer technology. 

Technical writing is actually my fourth career, but I don't intend to reinvent myself again because I love this field. Now that I finally found the career for me, I can go deep, so I spend my free time taking online trainings to improve my skills. These trainings include lots of coding exercises, some of which I upload to my GitHub profile to showcase my ability to read and write code, which is critical for technical writers in developer documentation.
