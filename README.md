Hi, I'm Anthony, an experienced technical writer of developer documentation.

Currently, I'm a contracted technical writer at Google, where I partner with software engineers to write and edit conceptual video scripts and task-based coding tutorials that help developers worldwide understand how to use Google's developer technology. 

Technical writing is actually my fourth career, but I don't intend to reinvent myself again because I love this field. Now that I finally found the career for me, I'm free to go deep, so I spend my free time taking online trainings that make me a better technical writer of developer documentation. To name a few, I've earned certifications in technical-communication fundamentals, basic programming, JSON, XML, RESTful API documentation, Git, and GitHub.
