# About me

Hi,

I'm Anthony, a seasoned technical writer of developer documentation with more than five years of experience in big banking and big tech.

Currently, I'm a senior technical writer in the Payments Technology division of the Commercial & Investment Bank at J.P. Morgan, where I'm responsible for a mix of internal and external documentation. 

Internally, I document the tools and processes that empower our developers to build our payments technology. For example, I documented the tools and processes that dictate how our developers must build our payment-processing APIs.

Externally, I document our payments technology for developers who use it to process payments. For example, I documented version 2 of our Global Payments API, a REST API that includes several payment rails, such as ACH. For each payment rail, I wrote a conceptual overview, how-to guides, and reference material.

Previously, I broke into technical writing as a contractor at Google, where I wrote and edited documentation that educated a global audience of developers about how to use Google's developer technology. I worked across various developer product areas as needed, including Android, Google Chrome, Google Maps Platform, and Google Pay.

Before I found my true calling as a technical writer, I dabbled in content writing, social-media marketing, and reporting. These areas might not sound relevant to technical writing, but they helped me gain many skills that I still find relevant today, such as how to formulate questions about how things work, how to interview sources to get desired information, and how to write quickly and accurately under tight deadlines.

In terms of hard skills, I'm knowledgeable of the following:
● Several markup languages, including Markdown
● Several programming languages, including JavaScript and Python
● Several other tools of note, including Acrolinx, Adobe Experience Manager, Android Studio, Bitbucket, Confluence, git, GitHub, Google Workspace, Frame.io, IntelliJ IDEA, Jira, macOS, Microsoft Office, style guides, Visual Studio Code, and Windows

In terms of soft skills, my colleagues and coworkers describe me as the following:
● Fast
● Smart
● Adaptable
● Self starter
● Independent
● A quick learner
● A problem solver
● Always willing to act
● Comfortable with ambiguity
● A leader when necessary as an individual contributor
