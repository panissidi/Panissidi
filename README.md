# About me

Hi, I'm Anthony, an experienced technical writer of developer documentation.

Currently, I'm a contracted technical writer at Google, where I write and edit conceputual video scripts, task-based coding tutorials, and quizzes that help developers worldwide use Google's developer technology. 

Technical writing is actually my fourth career, but I love this field, so I don't intend to reinvent myself again. Now that I finally found the career for me, I figured that it was time to create a portfolio of my work, so I created this GitHub profile for exactly that reason.

Thanks for reading!

Anthony
