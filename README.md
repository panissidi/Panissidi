# About me

Hi! 

I'm Anthony, a seasoned writer and editor with more than 10 years of experience, including 4 years of technical writing and technical editing.

Today, I'm a contractor at Google, where I educate more than 5 million developers of all skill levels around the world about Google's developer technology by writing and editing software documentation for various product areas (PAs) across the company, including AI/ML, cloud, mobile, payments, and web.

More specifically, I write and edit conceptual video scripts and task-based tutorials that involve various markup and programming languages by collaborating with designers, engineers, and product managers from different PAs. I also provide quality assurance by testing the documentation to ensure that it works as expected.

In addition, I help my team grow by documenting our internal processes; partaking in strategy meetings; and interviewing, hiring, onboarding, and mentoring new technical writers. In my spare time, I sharpen my skills by completing self-paced online trainings. For example, I taught myself the basics of Python and XML, and how to document REST APIs.

In terms of hard skills, I regularly work with the following:
* Several markup languages, including HTML and Markdown
* Several programming languages, including Kotlin and JavaScript
* Several other tools of note, including Acrolinx, Git, GitHub, Google Workspace, the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, and Frame.io

In terms of soft skills, my colleagues and coworkers describe me as the following: 
* Fast
* Smart
* Adaptable
* Independent
* A quick learner
* A problem solver
* Always willing to act
* * "Never makes a typo."
* Comfortable with ambiguity
* A leader when necessary as an individual contributor
* Funny (Some might say funny looking, but the point still standsâ€”I'm funny.)

To see samples of my writing, editing, and coding work, see the respective repositories.
