# About me

Hi, I'm Anthony, a seasoned technical writer and editor of globally distributed developer documentation.

Currently, I'm a remote and contracted technical writer at Google. In this role, I educate developers of all skill levels around the world about Google's developer technology through the technical writing and editing of software documentation for various product areas (PAs) across the company, including AI/ML, Android, Google Cloud, and Web. 

More specifically, I write and edit conceptual video scripts, task-based coding tutorials, and other forms of technical documentation by collaborating with engineering team members from different PAs. I also provide quality assurance by testing the documentation to ensure that it's accurate and all code works as expected. 

Technical writing is actually my fourth career, but I love this field, so I don't intend to reinvent myself again. Now that I finally found the career for me, I figured that it was time to create a portfolio of my publicly available work, so I created this GitHub profile. For writing samples, see the `writing_samples` repository. For editing samples, see the `editing_samples` repository. For code samples, see the `code_samples` repository.

Thanks for reading!

Anthony
